I am a YouTuber, with a channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsykqMNM8CtoynGQLtPnkeQ">Itzsten</a>.<br><br>My channel is about Cybersecurity, testing and showcasing malware,<br>which is <b>only</b> for educational and entertaining purposes only.<br><br><i>Malware is art!</i></b><br><br><br>I got intrested in technology about the age of 7, where there was a camp that my school advertised about coding and programming. I didn't really care about the fact that it was a coding camp, but neitherless, I just wanted some fun. So when we got there, we started coding. I didn't really know if I would like it, but as they sad it was game development. It wasn't the most complicated language, it was Scratch.<br>And- I didn't except it to be as fun as I thought it was!<br>And so I started to code! Subscribe!
